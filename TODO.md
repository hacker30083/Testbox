1️⃣ Planning & Research

- [ ] Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product): What is the simplest working version?

- [ ] Research Hypervisor APIs (e.g., Proxmox, VMware, or cloud solutions like AWS/GCP).

- [ ] Research Kubernetes minimization techniques for lightweight clusters.

- [ ] Choose a database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) for managing test environments.

- [ ] Explore existing CI/CD integrations that could complement your tool.



---

2️⃣ Backend Development (Java)

- [ ] Set up a Java backend using Spring Boot or another framework.

- [ ] Implement basic API endpoints for managing test environments:

- [ ] Create a new test environment.

- [ ] List all active test environments.

- [ ] Delete or reset an environment.


- [ ] Implement Hypervisor API communication (e.g., REST, SSH, or SDK).

- [ ] Implement Kubernetes integration to spin up lightweight test clusters.

- [ ] Implement database storage for environment metadata.



---

3️⃣ Infrastructure & Deployment

- [ ] Set up a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, k3s, or kind).

- [ ] Test deployments using Docker & Kubernetes manifests.

- [ ] Implement persistent storage for logs, database, and VM states.

- [ ] Implement basic logging & monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).



---

4️⃣ Frontend (TBD Technology)

- [ ] Choose a frontend framework (React, Vue, or a CLI tool?).

- [ ] Create a simple dashboard for managing test environments.

- [ ] Implement API calls to interact with the backend.

- [ ] Add basic user authentication if needed.



---

5️⃣ Testing & Optimization

- [ ] Write unit tests for backend services.

- [ ] Test Kubernetes deployments in different environments.

- [ ] Optimize startup time & resource usage of test environments.



---

6️⃣ Extra Features (Future Expansions)

- [ ] Add integration with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

- [ ] Implement test environment templates (preconfigured setups).

- [ ] Allow automatic teardown after a set period to free resources.

- [ ] Add multi-user support with role-based access control.
